CASDI research was started by Isti Anindya, S.Sc., M.Sc., while in the Biomedical Science Doctoral Programme at the University of Indonesia Faculty of Medicine. Dr. Amin Soebandrio, Sp.MK(K), PhD, Dr. Rini Sekartini, Sp.A(K), and Dr. Ibnu Agus Ariyanto, S.Si., M. Biomed. supervised Peduli ASD's founder. CASDI received Research and Innovation Funding for Advanced Indonesia (RIIM) from BRIN in 2023 and conducted its first study, "Development of a Screening Application for the Treatment of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder): Biomarker Study in CMV (Cytomegalovirus) Seropositive ASD Children and Its Association with Autistic Conditions." This first study examines IL-1B and IL-6 cytokine profiles as immunological biomarkers. IL-1B and IL-6 cytokine profiles have been linked to autism in several studies. Inflammation and infection are responded to by these immune system cytokines. Autistic children have higher blood and cerebrospinal fluid IL-1B and IL-6 levels than non-autistic children, according to several studies. Increased cytokines indicate immune system activation or inflammation in autistic people.

Brain development, function, and behaviour can be affected by inflammation. Autism symptoms like impaired social communication, sensory disturbances, and repetitive and restricted behaviour have been linked to high IL-1B and IL-6 levels in several studies. Increased cytokines are linked to sleep disorders, anxiety, and other behavioural issues in autistic people. Remember that autistic people have different IL-1B and IL-6 cytokine profiles. Individuals' immune responses to inflammation or infection vary. Additionally, more research is needed to determine how these cytokine profiles affect autistic behaviour. No specific treatment is currently available based on this cytokine profile, but understanding cytokines in autism may help develop better treatments.

Additionally, this study examined ASD children's exposure to Cytomegalovirus (CMV), which may affect their IL-1B and IL-6 cytokine profiles. An infected pregnant mother or newborn can infect the foetus with CMV. CMV infection can cause a child's immune system to produce IL-1B and IL-6. These cytokines regulate immune cell communication and inflammation and infection response. CMV induces IL-1B and IL-6 via multiple mechanisms. CMV infects tissue cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. These cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1B and IL-6 during infection. CMV can also affect immune pathways and signal other immune cells to produce cytokines.

Increased IL-1B and IL-6 production from CMV infection can cause systemic or local inflammation. Inflammation can impair nerve function and increase the risk of neurological disorders like autism. High IL-1B and IL-6 levels are linked to autism symptoms like social communication, sensory disturbances, and repetitive behaviour. Remember that CMV immune responses vary by person. Not all children have a strong immune response and higher IL-1B and IL-6 levels. Environmental and genetic factors can affect immune response.

CASDI researchers hope this research will benefit autism research and enable future CMV, ASD, and Immunology research.
